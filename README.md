# Smart-Home
project was designed to monitor and control various aspects of the home environment, including temperature
and prayer times. I integrated a temperature sensor into the system to sense the temperature and adjust the
fan speed accordingly.
Additionally, I developed an LCD display to show the prayer times and enabled users to set their preferred
prayer times using a keypad. The prayer times were then saved in the EEPROM for future reference ..etc

I used in this project (Atmega32 – UART – I2C – LCD – EEPROM – Keypad – Servo Motor – DC Motor –
LM35 – 7 Segment – LDR).
